# Telephone_Directory_System
This program allows users to manage a telephone directory through a console-based interface. Users can perform the following operations:

Add Record: Add a new contact with name, address, and phone number to the directory.

Show All Records: Display all contacts currently stored in the directory.

Search Record: Search for a contact by name and display their details if found.

Modify Record: Update details (name, address, phone number) of a contact based on their phone number.

Delete Record: Remove a contact from the directory based on their phone number.

Exit: Terminate the program.

The program uses file handling (fstream) to store and retrieve contact information persistently. It ensures user-friendly interaction through simple text-based menus and input prompts, making it easy to manage and maintain a list of contacts.
